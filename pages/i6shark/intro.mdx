# Intro to i6.shark

i6.shark is an IPv6 proxy server that allows you to make HTTP requests from randomly generated IPv6 addresses in a /48 subnet. This is the proxy currently powering Wyzie Subs in production.

A /48 subnet has `1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176` (1.2 × 10²⁴) IPv6 addresses, making it virtually impossible to block through traditional IP banning. Using a single subnet means those who really want to block you can block your ASN address, so be careful with that.

## Features

- **Random IPv6 Generation**: Creates random IPv6 addresses from your /48 prefix for each request
- **Full HTTP Method Support**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and all other HTTP methods
- **HMAC-SHA256 Authentication**: Secure API key authentication using user-agent based tokens
- **Intelligent IP Pool Management**: 
  - Automatic IP rotation with configurable pool size
  - Smart IP lifecycle management (add, track usage, auto-flush)
  - Per-IP request counting with automatic rotation after max requests
  - Unused IP cleanup based on inactivity threshold
- **Advanced Request Handling**:
  - Custom header forwarding via JSON query parameter
  - Cloudflare and CDN header stripping for anonymity
  - Support for multiple URL parameter formats (`?url=`, `?destination=`, or path-based)
  - Optional fallback to system default IP with `?normal` parameter
- **Host Whitelisting**: Built-in domain whitelist for security (configurable in code)
- **Automatic Maintenance**:
  - Periodic IP pool flushing (hourly by default)
  - Subnet validation and cleanup
  - Connection pooling and keepalive optimization
- **High Performance**:
  - Concurrent request handling with buffer pooling
  - Configurable timeouts and connection limits
  - Efficient IPv6 address management via netlink
- **Debug Mode**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and monitoring

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or higher
- Linux/Unix system with IPv6 support (preferably Ubuntu)
- Root privileges (for port 80 binding and IPv6 manipulation)
- IPv6 /48 subnet allocation from your hosting provider
