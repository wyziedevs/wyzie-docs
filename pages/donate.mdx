# Please Donate

Hello user, Wyzie is kind of relying on donations now (which I barely get) and I am 16 with a part time job and sometimes my bill for running the public API exceeds 100$ a month. I can't continue to support this if i don't get external help, I am truly sorry but this project has grown beyond what I originally could support out of my pocket.
